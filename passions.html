                    <p>I remember during 5th grade, my mom slightly bribed me into joining KAMA which stands for Korean American Music Academy.
                        At the time, I had zero interest in singing. However, after a couple months of being inside KAMA, I began to notice that I 
                        was practicing singing on my own unconsciously. I realized that I felt differently whenever I was singing because it was an 
                        opportunity for me to express myself and delve deeper into my passions.

                <div class = "col-3">
                    <p>After being deeply involved with the KAMA community, I began to find new opportunities in which I could provide a service while
                        practicing my passions. It just so happened that our church was in need of a lead singer. Without hesitation, I knew I had to 
                        take the opportunity. Starting September 2017, I began to attend the weekly practices so that we could prepare for the band 
                        performances every sunday at our church.

                    <p>It was my sophomore year in highschool and I recently got into tennis with a couple of my friends. We were all on the tennis 
                        team together and practiced almost daily at the local park. I distincttly remember one of my friends' dad decided to take me
                        and my friends to the YMCA that was around a 3 minute drive from the park. I did not have a membership so they just snuck me in.
                        I remember laying on a bench and struggled to bench 65 pounds. However, even though I struggled to lift the weights, the adrenaline 
                        that I had while lifting and the soreness after inspired me to come back the next day,

                    <p>After a couple months of consistent weight training, I began to see massive changes in my body and that raised my self-esteem and 
                        confidence. Prior to working out, I always had issues with body dysmorphia and weight. This new endeavor and passions that I discovered 
                        has laid the foundatioon for the healthy lifestyle that I live today.

                    <p>However, I know the overwhelming and fearful feeling that many people have when first entering the gym because I felt the same way when I 
                        first entered the gym. However, since I had my friends beside me, it was not as bad. I know that many people may not have friends that they
                        can rely on when entering the gym for the first time. So, for some assistance I have developed a workout search for anyone who would
